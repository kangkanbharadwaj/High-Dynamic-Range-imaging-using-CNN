# Learning HDR Imaging from Synthetic data


## Objective

1.  Creation of a static dataset using blender
2.  Learn a model on the data
3.  Use the model to test real scenes

## Introduction

  *  LDR: Images of 0-255 pixel range, can be displayed on a standard device.
  *  HDR: Range of luminance that is equivalent to the one experienced by a human eye (upto 105).
  *  Tone-mapping: The scene with original irradiance(linear space) is mapped to pixel values of (0-255).
