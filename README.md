# LDR---HDR-prediction
Predict HDR images from LDR images using CNN
The Low Dynamic Range (LDR) images are initially created using Blender. The scenes used in this process are synthetic. We do not have a ground truth at present and hence the High Dynamic Range (HDR) images are also created using blender. These images are trained using a Convolution Neural Network and the loss is monitored to assure the possibility to work with authentic digital images in the future.
